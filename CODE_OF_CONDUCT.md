# Code of conduct

We are committed to creating a welcoming environment for Mexplorer. Be excellent to each other; weâ€™re building a community after all. If you run into problems with others in our community, please contact me or any repo maintainer.

This is a first draft of the code of conduct and will be updated accordingly in the near future.

This section is a work in progress.
